# Abstract

# Introduction

## Last paragraph segue

We set out to measure the variation in patient and practice factors for patients with septic shock cared for within critical care units in Europe.

# Methods

Inclusion

- consecutive admissions with requiring noradrenaline for presumed sepsis 

- mention that we extracted data to mirror that reported in Morelli
	- NAd for MAP > 65 
	- for 24 hours

# Results

## Study description

We included 736 patients from 8 hospitals in 4 European countries. Patients were eligible if they were treated with an infusion of noradrenaline for at least 24 hours, and considered likely to have sepsis.

## Patients

The mean age for patients studied was 70 years (SD 10) ...

## Process measures

- sedation
- fluid management
	- first 24 hours
	- cumulative
- vasopressor use
	- noradrenaline dose
    - VADI score
 
## Variation at baseline

i.e. before delivery of critical care with a focus on

- organ dysfunction
- type of sepsis
- pre-ITU LOS

## Planned subgroups

- those meeting new sepsis definitions criteria
- those meeting Morelli criteria
- those admitted 'fresh' to ICU (i.e. pre-ICU LOS < 24h)


# Discussion

We were/weren't able to identify a cohort of patients where the variation was/wasn't affected by site/practice parameters.
