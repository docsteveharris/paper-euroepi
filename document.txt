We set out to measure the variation in patient and practice factors for patients with septic shock cared for within critical care units in Europe. In particular, we sought to determine whether important treatment variables during the first 24 hours could explain differences in noradrenaline use.

Methods
=======

Patients
--------

We recruited one hundred consecutive admissions with septic shock from
eight critical care units across Europe. Patients were eligible if they
were locally diagnosed and treated for infection, required a vasopressor
infusion after 24 hours of stabilisation in the critical care unit, and
had not received beta-blocker therapy during the same time period.

Definitions
-----------

-   need to describe vasopressor and sedation scores

Statistical analaysis
---------------------

Results
=======

We screened 730 consecutive admissions with septic shock from 8
hospitals in 4 European countries. We excluded 3 patients (0.4%) who
were discharged within 24 hours (one survivor, one non-surivor); 97
patients (13.3%) who received beta-blocker therapy during the first 24
hours; and, 162 patients (22.2%) where noradrenaline infusions had been
weaned by 24 hours. The final cohort included 487 patients with each
hospital contributing a median of 67 patients (IQR 56 to 73).

Patient characteristics
-----------------------

<!-- see Table 1 -->
Vasopressor support for septic shock commenced on the first ICU day for
311 (75%) patients, and pneumonia was the commonest cause of infection
(223 patients, 46%). The median SOFA score at 24 hours was 10 (IQR 8 to
12). The majority (424 patients, 87%) were mechanically ventilated, and
140 (29%) had already started renal replacement therapy(RRT) at 24
hours. The overall ICU mortality was 41% (198 deaths), and the hospital
mortality was 48% (233 deaths).

Morelli criteria to compare in table

-   age &lt; 18
-   beta-blockers prior to randomisation
-   cardiac index &lt; 2.2 with high LAP
-   significant valvular heart disease

Variation in practice between sites
-----------------------------------

-   sedation
-   fluid management
-   patient characteristics

Variation in mortality between sites
------------------------------------



## Planned subgroups

- those admitted 'fresh' to ICU (i.e. pre-ICU LOS < 24h)


# Discussion

We were/weren't able to identify a cohort of patients where the variation was/wasn't affected by site/practice parameters.
